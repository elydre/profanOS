.SH NAME
xorriso\-tcltk \-  Educational GUI frontend for xorriso
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xorriso-tcltk
[ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBxorriso\-tcltk\fR
demonstrates xorriso use cases by a collection of GUI components.
.br
.PP
It creates a window with buttons, editable text fields, and list boxes.
For exploration simply start
\fBxorriso\-tcltk\fR
without any options.
.br
.PP
Click on the "Help" button at the upper right edge to get an overview help
text in a separate window. It explains the three main parts of the GUI window
and it gives examples for a few main use cases of xorriso.
.br
.PP
Click by the rightmost mouse button on any button, list box, or text field,
to get a specific help text in another window.
.br
.PP
\fBxorriso\fR
is a program which copies file objects from POSIX compliant
filesystems into Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and performs
session\-wise manipulation of such filesystems. It can load the management
information of existing ISO images and it writes the session results to
optical media or to filesystem objects.
.br
Vice versa \fBxorriso\fR is able to copy file objects out of ISO 9660
filesystems.
.SS
.br
.SH OPTIONS
.br
.PP
Normally, no program options are needed when 
\fBxorriso\-tcltk\fR
gets started. Some of the options are for demonstration of program development.
This man page lists only those options which may be helpful for end users.
.PP
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Print a help text with the complete list of start options and exit.
.TP
\fB--no_extract\fR
Do not allow extraction of files from ISO filesystem to
hard disk. This is not revokable during the program run.
.TP
\fB--geometry\fR {+|-}X{+|-}Y
Set the position of the main window on the screen. +0X is the left edge,
\-0X is the right edge, +0Y is the upper edge, \-0Y is the lower edge.
